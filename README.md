<center><h2> What is this repository for? </h2> </center>

<p> Coding interviews are tough and finding proper resources to solve questions and learn various programming concepts, This repository is a collection of multiple topics and most asked questions that I faced during my preparation for placements. This  repository follows  multiple resources that are popular for learning programming, including Love Babbar's 450 sheet, leetcode questions, etc .I hope to make this project as open source as possible to provide help to a wide range of developers and students looking for a job.</p>

You may notice  a lot of the code files are missing and I apologize for that, when I was solving these questions I used online IDE's of leetcode and GFG and only had handful of the solution in file format. As time progress I will continue to add the solutions into the respective repositories.

<br>

All of the people who wants to contribute to the repository are also welcome to do so, no matter is the questions belong to 450 DSA or simply belong to the topic and is important.
